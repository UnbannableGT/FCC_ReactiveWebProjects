# FCC_ReactiveWebProjects
This is the start to a public archive of the project I build as I dive into coding.
Most of these projects will likely appear unifinished as they are likely made to satisfy a specific goal.
Over time, I may come back through and refine these.
I'll probably come back and leave some sort of journal entry here after I complete the projects.
We'll see.

Feel free to email me joey@joeyherring.com or hit me on discord UnbannableGT#1130.

~~This works, but CSS styling takes forever to load, will investigate.~~

CSS loading times may vary. Ninja site is horribly broken on mobile.
