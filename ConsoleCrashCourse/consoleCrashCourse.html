                    I'm writing this manual to teach some of the meta behind programming MA2 as I've had the opportunity to 
                    play with or watch others play with for the last few years. I've considered doing this in video format, 
                    but there's something special to me about RTFM, and I needed to write a technical documentation page for 
                    my web coding class. I hope you enjoy this manual, I have always been a fan of a well written manual and this is 
                    my first attempt at anything of the sort, it will likely be a journey for the both of us. I'll 
                    be starting with the basics, and hopefully expanding as time allows. If this page was useful, share it at 
                    your liesure. If not, leave a comment on the <a class="main-section" href="https://github.com/UnbannableGT/FreeCodeCampProjects">github page here.</a>

                <p class="main-section">
                    Before I explain how to use the console, there are a few things I want to explain to you. You may think programming 
                    lights for rock shows and raves is about making the lights do things, but you're wrong. Its all about the way how you're 
                    able to reference the mind melting (and your partiularly earth shattering style of a) sym bally look at the perfect time. And 
                    also making sure that when you call that bally up, you aren't turing the stage work lights on at full. Yeah -it happens- you 
                    just gotta roll with the punches. This guide is here to help you make sure that doesnt happen and you'll graduate to finding 
                    out you've lost timecode when the intro track starts rolling, or your console gets rained on mid set and the band ain't stopping, 
                    or the fabled downbeat crash. It all happens and you'll take it in stride, just like the rest of us. Anyway, enough anecdote. 
                    Think about learning lighting from a standpoint of data managment. All you're doing is stacking layers of data, some data can 
                    push through some layers, but not others. Some data can push through any layer. The layers contain objects that have data stored to them. 
                    Don't worry if none of that makes sense, I'll explain in more detail later. Hopefully as you make it further into the guide this will begin 
                    to make some sense. I promise, we'll make a light show eventually, but there's a lot that goes into making that process easy and enjoyable.

            <section id="Your_New_Showfile" class="main-section">

                <header class="main-section">Your New Showfile</header>

                <p class="main-section">
                    First thing you're gonna want to do is make a new showfile, check all settings. Start from scratch. Next go into settings > users & profiles and make yourself a profile, then user based on that profile.
                    Make sure you give yourself admin privelages, and log in. This is important for annoying reasons, but can save you at showtime on a big festival.
                </p>

                <p class="main-section">
                    Okay, now that we're acting as us, and not the admin we're ready to patch. Open settings > patch & fixture schedule. Here's where all of the data for the lights in your show is stored. 
                    Think of layers like user defined groupings of fixture data. Patch is the main folder, layers are folders inside the main folder, and fixtures have to go in a folder. 
                    More to come as I refine this. I usually group by fixture type, but I know some people like to group by truss or element, and vectorworks import creates a structure.
                    Create some fixtures, I like to think about what fixtures I'm going to use so we can see the talent, what I'm going to use to texture the stage with, how I'm goig to 
                    texture the air, how I'm going to highlight parts of the set/band members, and what do I have that I can make 'pop'. 
                    <br>
                    If you have access to another showfile with built 3D, you can use partial show read, wizard merge all. 
                </p> 

                <p class="main-section">
                   Now that you've got some fixtures patched, escape out of the settings menu, and you should have a blank screen. I won't go too far into telling you how to lay your show out, through
                   this guide, you'll see what windows are accessed frequently and build it to your liking. I will say however, I'm personally fond of dynamic preset view and layout view interfaces. We'll 
                   talk about these more later. Keep in mind: if you want to store a view to all screens, every time you store it you have to store all. You'll get caught by that one more that you'll like.

                <p class="main-section">
                    Presets are the most fundamental data type in MA. They're the bottom level of of the data stack. Any time you're referencing data to send to a light, it should be 
                    through a preset. Most lights have many parameters like Dimmer, Pan, Tilt, Color, etc. Groups of parameters are called attributes, you should have 6 or so depending on  
                    what you've got patched. Tap in the top left corner of the screen to make a window. Find the Dynamic window under the presets tab. Pick it. Drag the bottom right corner of the screen 
                    resize the widow to half of the screen size. I personally like landscape windows, but I know some are fond of the portrait. Find your flow. Tap in the shaded cell with the 
                    orange ball, but not on the orange ball, and drag to move your window around. Tap in the top left corner of your empty space and create a group window from the pools tab. 
                    Press the -store- key, and store it in one of empty cells in the bar on the right side of your screen. Most of your views will go here.
